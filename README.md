# Data Engineering Learning Journey

Welcome to my data engineering learning journey! This repository serves as a structured path through essential data engineering concepts and skills.

Each major learning topic or module is organized into its own dedicated Git branch, allowing for focused development and easy navigation.

## Explore the Journey:

- [**Fundamentals of Data Engineering** (Branch: `topic/fundamentals-de`)](https://github.com/mnizhadali-afg/data-engineering-journey/tree/topic/fundamentals-de)
- [**SQL for Data Engineering** (Branch: `topic/sql`)](https://github.com/mnizhadali-afg/data-engineering-journey/tree/topic/sql)
- [**Python for Data Engineering** (Branch: `topic/python`)](https://github.com/mnizhadali-afg/data-engineering-journey/tree/topic/python)

*(More topics will be added here as the journey progresses!)*
